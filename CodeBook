##ASSIGNMENT -GETTING AND CLEANING DATA

The data was obtained from: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

* DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLES IN THE DATA

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and 
tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they 
were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to 
remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ)using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the 
Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

* CODE DESCRIPTION 

The goal is to prepare tidy data
This code creates a tidy data set as per assignment requirements The variables are used as mentioned in the assigment

step 1: All the text files are read into the R using read.table

step 2: The datasets are binded together by using rbind forming a data sets \ --variables from features.txt
(containing data with x_train and x_test) --subject --Activity (containing data with y_train and y_test)

step3:(question 1) 
the datasets with x values and subject are binded

step 4:(question 2) 
using grep variables with name "mean" and "std" are subsetted

step 5:(question 3) 
the values under activity with y (y_text,y_train -both combined) values are binded with dataset formed earlier 
forming a complete dataset

step 6:(question 4)
the activity has been replaced with activity labels

step 7: (question 5) 
a final data set has been created calculating the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

step 8: 
the final data set has been exported to text file
